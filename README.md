# Dance Ball


Dance Ball is another simple yet fun and addictive game created with the help of [UnityGameEngine](https://unity.com/) in C#.

The objective is simple, a few collectibles and some obstacles come rolling towards you. You need to dodge them and try to collect as many collectibles(Golden Rotating Cubes) as possible.Try not to fall or else game over 

Your score is based on the distance you travel and the number of orbs you collect.

Navigating your ball is also pretty simple. Move with <kbd>↑</kbd>
<kbd>↓</kbd>
<kbd>→</kbd>
<kbd>←</kbd> keys, or  <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> keys. You can jump using the <kbd>Space</kbd> key. By pressing the <kbd>CapsLock</kbd> key you can activate a special power, but it activates only for a couple of seconds and has a cool down of few seconds.

Use the mouse to control your camera. Moving left-right moves the camera accordingly, while up-down motion will bring the camera closer or farther from the ball.


Each orb successfully collected will give you a +10 while for every 10m travelled you get a +1. Press the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key to pause the game.

The speed of the blocks increases with time , thus gradually increasing the difficulty.

Surely you will enjoy playing this game.
